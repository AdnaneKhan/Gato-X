        Identify potential injection vulnerabilities within GitHub workflows.

        This method analyzes the workflow graph to detect injection issues by
        examining paths from nodes tagged with relevant injection-related tags
        (e.g., "issue_comment", "pull_request_target") and checking for vulnerabilities
        based on environment variables and input parameters.

        The analysis involves:
        1. Retrieving all nodes tagged with specific injection-related tags from the workflow graph.
        2. For each of these nodes, performing a Depth-First Search (DFS) to find paths
           that lead to nodes tagged with "injectable".
        3. Iterating through each path and analyzing nodes to determine potential injection
           vulnerabilities based on variable handling and environment rules.
        4. Aggregating the results and rendering them in an ASCII format for easy visualization.

        Args:
            graph (TaggedGraph): The workflow graph containing all nodes and their relationships.
            api (Api): An instance of the API wrapper to interact with GitHub APIs.
            ignore_workflow_run (bool, optional): Flag to determine whether to ignore "workflow_run" tags. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            None

        Raises:
            Exception: Logs any exceptions that occur during the processing of individual paths,
                       allowing the analysis to continue without interruption.
